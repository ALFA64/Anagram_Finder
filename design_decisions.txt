1. Maintainability: 
	The program is simple, clear, and easy to maintain. It uses a dictionary where the keys are sorted anagrams, and each key is associated with a list of words.
	This structure is intuitive and does not rely on complex external libraries, ensuring the code remains manageable and extensible.

2. Scalability: 
	The dictionary-based approach scales well as it grows proportionally with the number of words. 
	For handling 10 million words, no significant changes are required. Each word is sorted (O(m log m)) and inserted into the dictionary (O(1)), which is efficient for typical word lengths.

3. Performance: 
	The program operates efficiently by minimizing operations. The dictionary ensures fast access and insertion. Sorting each word is the most time-consuming operation (O(m log m)), but it is manageable for typical word lengths.
	 No external libraries are used, minimizing overhead.

Scalability Considerations:

	Handling 10 million words:
		The program can handle 10 million words without significant changes. The dictionary structure is well-suited for this scale, with minimal overhead.

	Handling 100 billion words (and beyond):
		For 100 billion words, the following changes would be required:
		Parallel Processing: Distribute the processing across multiple machines to handle the large volume.
		Disk Storage: Use a database or disk storage for intermediate results, as in-memory storage would be inefficient.
		Batch Processing: Process the data in batches to avoid overloading memory and improve overall performance.
		Database: Use a database for efficient querying and indexing, replacing in-memory dictionaries.
